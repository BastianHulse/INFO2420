<p>Utah Backyard Birds began with a bird lover who took way too many pictures. Bart Jones started out as a backyard bird watcher.</p>
<p>He was an artist and photographer and birds were one of his favorite subjects.
Many of the birds also captured in watercolors,<br> usually with some tree or flowers in the background.</p>
<p>Bart would set out many different kinds of feed to attract as many bird varieties as possible.<br> Soon his backyard in Eureka became an aviary and the expense of keeping all his feathered visitors fed was impacting his pocketbook. </p>

<p>After developing hundreds of bird photos and creating about a hundred watercolors, Bart decided to see how he could translate<br> his passion for these feathered friends into a money making venture. He decided to try to create a calendar and associated<br> postcard book and sell them to those who would enjoy the local wildlife.

Utah Backyard Birds began as a company in 1997. Bart Jones compiled a wide variety of his best and most unique bird photos into a calendar<br> and postcard book series. His product line is available through this website and also can be found in Nature Lovers stores countrywide.<br> Each month of the calendar contains interesting information about the bird variety depicted for that month. 
</p>
 
<p>Not only does Bart just capture these birds, but he has also researched their behaviors, migration patterns and is a reservoir of information<br> about local Utah birds. He felt that he could share this knowledge with others as well as his wonderful still life photographs and artwork.

<p>While Utah Backyard Birds is still a young company, the artwork and photographic creations of Bart Jones have received much adulation<br> from art critics as well as the public. Many customers are repeat buyers year after year.</p>
<p>Visitors to Utah can purchase the postcard books at local bookstores, the Salt Lake Airport and also at local grocery stores.</p>
<p>Bart Jones has big plans for the future of the company. He would soon like to branch out into sharing his images of insects and arachnids (spiders).<br> Some of his macro-photography is truly inspiring. </p>

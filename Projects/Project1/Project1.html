<h2>Questions:</h2>

<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>

it? Why?</li>

reasonable?</li>

<h2> Website 1 Critiques</h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/home">www.traderjoes.com</a></h4>

	<li>My first impression of this site is that it looks well-designed and unique.</li>
	<li>This site has a ribbon on the left that links to products, discover, recipes, and listen. Other than that the home page displays a few of their choices of each category. It also has a table of contents like bottom linking to more specific things and also company information.</li>
	<li>It definitely makes sense. It is simple and easy to understand. I definitely think it is unique with its art style and design choices, but it doesn't confuse me. It just adds a nice flare.</li>
	<li>I definitely think the graphics enhance this site. Like I said above they are unique, and instead of confusing me, it sticks to my mind. They also do keep the consistent style that they have throughout.</li>
	<li>The load was practically instant. Very reasonable.</li>
	<li>The text is easily readable, black and dark gray on a white (sometimes super light coloring) background.</li>
	<li>Yes, the site has a navigation ribbon hanging from the left. It is unique, but easy to use.</li>
	<li>The site typically sticks to the black text and white background, but they do have graphics to keep you from feeling that it is repetitive.</li>
	<li>When making the window smaller it scaled a bit oddly, and the ribbon for easy navigation on the left side vanished.</li>
	<li>I really like the ribbon on the left side that follows me as I scroll. I can look at their featured things, but always easily get where I want to.</li>

<h2> Website 2 Critiques</h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.pitchfork.com">www.pitchfork.com</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>My first impression of this site is that it is very modern looking.</li>
	<li>This site has a ribbon on the top to navigate to different sections. It also displays recent articles first on the home page. They also chose some things to feature.</li>
	<li>This site is okay. I can definitely find something specific using the search button and it successfully shows off recent news. I don't personally love the design as it doesn't feel very unique, but it is fine.</li>
	<li>I think it is fine. The design still enhances the site instead of detracting from it, but it does feel very basic and templatey.</li>
	<li>The site takes a second-sh to load all of the images from the articles. Decently fast.</li>
	<li>Large text for the article titles, all very readable using the gray, black, and white scheme.</li>
	<li>The navigation bar is on the top. This is very normal, so it is fine.</li>
	<li>I personally feel like this one did get repetitive. Some people may say it is purposefully minimalistic, but I think the black and white is just average and can get boring. Buit as this site is for news, that vibe fits.</li>
	<li>Everything just scaled down with me, until it got small enough that it only showed one article at a time.</li>
	<li>The ribbon is always accessible as long as you scroll up once. That is nice.</li>

<h2> Website 3 Critiques</h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.jamilin.com">www.jamilin.com</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>My first impression of this site was ew. It is all of the place, awful resolution on the pictures. I wouldn't trust this site with my email let alone card info.</li>
	<li>This site has links everywhere. So much is on the page that nothing feels organized. It is extremely cluttered and honestly upsetting. She has a link to her home page on her home page.</li>
	<li>There is so much crammed onto the first page. It doesn't have a lot of length to it, but there are three links that go to the same place for each of the subpages. Very confusing.</li>
	<li>The graphics on this site definitely take away from the site. Bad quality gives me an inherent distrust of the site. The pictures have an awful resolution and they are all just of her.</li>
	<li>It loaded in a few seconds. Nothing to write home about, but not really an issue either.</li>
	<li>The text was mostely readable, but the sheer amount of solors that they were on isn't good. White on yellow is readable sure, but not advisable. Also yellow on navy is a choice that can be made for sure.</li>
	<li>The navigation bar is on the top, it is the colors of the rainbow. The left link is to the home page you are already on.</li>
	<li>Each section has a different color scheme. This is different sure, but makes me sick. Every time I clicked on a link it made me upset.</li>
	<li>It scaled fine, the smaller it got the more of the sections dropped to different rows.</li>
	<li>This was hard, I hate this site, but she did embed the social media so you can find her pages with one click.</li>
